A test project to develop and improve my javascript skills. It is a Twitter clone/parody not meant to be taken seriously. Enjoy! 

Yes there are bugs, but I need to finish my curriculum, where I will learn how to fix them later. I dont want to get too sidetracked, I've already exceeded my stretch goals with this. Cheers!
